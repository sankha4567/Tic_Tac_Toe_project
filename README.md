Tic-Tac-Toe Game (Java Implementation)
Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game that is simple to learn but offers strategic depth. This project implements the game in Java, allowing two players to compete in an interactive and enjoyable experience.

Game Rules
The game is played on an n × n grid (default: 3 × 3).
Players take turns marking a cell with "X" or "O".
The first player to place three of their marks in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins.
If the grid is filled and no player has won, the game ends in a draw.
Features
✅ Interactive CLI-based gameplay
✅ Dynamic grid size (n × n support)
✅ Win detection for rows, columns, and diagonals
✅ Draw detection when all cells are filled
✅ Option to restart the game after a round ends
